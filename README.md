## Play Audio Clips

This is a simple project I made in an attempt to learn how to play mp3 files on the click of a button.
This project was made using Howler(https://www.npmjs.com/package/howler)

### Run Project

To run the project simply do an npm install to install the dependencies and then npm start to start up.
